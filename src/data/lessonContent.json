Hate speech is not protected.\n\n**Q: Can my employer fire me for my social media posts?**\nA: Fundamental Rights primarily protect against State action, not private employers. However, labor laws and service contracts may protect you.\n\n**Q: Is Aadhaar mandatory? Doesn't it violate privacy?**\nA: After 2019 SC judgment, Aadhaar is mandatory only for PAN, income tax, government benefits. Not mandatory for bank accounts, mobile phones, school admissions.\n\n**Q: Can police arrest me without warrant?**\nA: Only in cognizable offenses (serious crimes). They must inform you of grounds, let you contact lawyer, produce you before magistrate within 24 hours.\n\n**Q: What if I can't afford a lawyer?**\nA: Legal aid is your right under Article 39A (DPSP). Every High Court and district has Legal Services Authority providing free lawyers to poor people.\n\n**Q: Can I be forced to sing National Anthem?**\nA: No. Supreme Court (2017) said it's not mandatory in cinema halls. But willful prevention or insult is punishable.\n\n**Q: Do Fundamental Rights apply in private disputes?**\nA: Generally no - they protect against State action. But concept of 'State' is broad, includes government companies, authorities. Private entities can't directly violate them, but laws can regulate private conduct.",

However, some duties are enforced through separate laws (like education, damaging public property).\n\n**Q: If I don't stand for National Anthem, what happens?**\nA: There's a law (Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act) that can punish deliberate insult. But courts have clarified it's not mandatory in cinema halls (2017 judgment).\n\n**Q: Are Fundamental Duties only for Indian citizens?**\nA: Yes, unlike some Fundamental Rights that apply to all persons, duties apply only to citizens.\n\n**Q: Why aren't Fundamental Duties enforceable like Rights?**\nA: Rights protect individuals from state power. Duties are meant as moral compass, not legal requirements. Making them all enforceable could be seen as state overreach.\n\n**Q: Should voting be a Fundamental Duty?**\nA: There's debate. Some say yes (democracy needs participation). Others say forced voting isn't democratic. Currently not a duty.\n\n**Q: Can these duties change?**\nA: Yes, Parliament can amend. In fact, 11th duty was added in 2002. Experts have suggested adding more (voting, paying taxes, etc.)",
